# devcontainer-template

## Purpose

Universal DevContainer shell providing cutting-edge AI agents, skills, and workflows to bootstrap any project. Reliability first: agents reason deeply, cross-reference sources, and self-correct until the output meets quality standards.

## Project Structure

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript/Node.js, Visual Basic, R, Pascal, Perl, Fortran, PHP, Rust, Go, Ada, MATLAB, Assembly, Kotlin, Swift, COBOL, Ruby, Dart, Lua, Scala, Elixir, SQL
- **Cloud CLIs**: AWS v2, GCP SDK, Azure CLI
- **IaC**: Terraform, Vault, Consul, Nomad, Packer, Ansible
- **Containers**: Docker, kubectl, Helm
- **AI**: Claude Code, RTK (token savings), MCP servers (GitHub, GitLab, grepai, context7 + feature-based: Playwright, ktn-linter)

## How to Work

1. **New project**: `/init` → conversational discovery → doc generation
2. **New feature**: `/plan "description"` → planning mode → `/do` → `/git --commit`
3. **Bug fix**: `/plan "description"` → planning mode → `/do` → `/git --commit`
4. **Code review**: `/review` → 3-tier review (agents + Qodo + CodeRabbit)

Branch conventions: `feat/<desc>` or `fix/<desc>`, commit prefix matches.

## Key Principles

**Reliability first**: Verify before generating. Agents consult context7 and official docs before producing non-trivial code.

**MCP-first**: Use MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`, `mcp__gitlab__*`) before CLI fallbacks. Auth is pre-configured.

**Self-correction**: When linting or tests fail, agents fix and retry automatically.

**Semantic search**: Use `grepai_search` for meaning-based queries. Fall back to Grep for exact strings.

**Specialist agents**: Language conventions enforced by agents that know current stable versions.

**Deep reasoning**: For complex tasks — Peek, Decompose, Parallelize, Synthesize.

## Safeguards

Ask before:
- Deleting files in `.claude/` or `.devcontainer/`
- Removing features from `.claude/commands/*.md`
- Removing hooks from `.devcontainer/hooks/`
- Dropping database state, force-push, dependency downgrades

Investigate before deleting unfamiliar state (branches, lock files, unknown files) — it may be user work-in-progress.

When refactoring: move content to separate files, preserve logic.

## Pre-commit

Auto-detected by language marker (`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, etc.). Priority: Makefile targets, then language-specific commands.

## Hooks (17 event types)

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| SessionStart | Cache project metadata + compact recovery |
| SessionEnd | Session cleanup |
| UserPromptSubmit | Prompt tracking |
| PreToolUse | Commit validate, security scan, RTK rewrite, logging |
| PostToolUse | Format + lint, security, test, feature update, logging |
| PostToolUseFailure | Failure diagnostics |
| PermissionRequest | Permission logging |
| SubagentStart/Stop | Agent lifecycle tracking |
| Stop | Session summary + terminal bell + quality gate (lint/typecheck/test) |
| TeammateIdle | Multi-agent coordination |
| TaskCompleted | Async task completion |
| ConfigChange | Configuration change tracking |
| WorktreeCreate/Remove | Git worktree lifecycle |
| PreCompact | Context preservation before compaction |
| Notification | External monitoring notifications |

## /secret - Secure Secret Management (1Password)

```
/secret --push DB_PASSWORD=mypass     # Store secret
/secret --get DB_PASSWORD             # Retrieve secret
/secret --list                        # List project secrets
/secret --push KEY=val --path org/other  # Cross-project
```

**Path convention:** `<org>/<repo>/<key>` (auto-resolved from git remote)
**Backend:** 1Password CLI (`op`) with `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`
**Integration:** `/init` (check), `/git` (scan), `/do` (discover), `/infra` (TF_VAR_*)

## Collaboration Rules

**Response style**
- Terse. No trailing summary ("I did X, Y, Z"). The diff and output are enough.
- Lead with action or decision, not with preamble.
- French or English to match the user's language.

**Tool discipline**
- Dedicated tools over Bash equivalents: Read (not cat), Edit (not sed), Glob (not find), Grep (not grep).
- Read the full file before modifying it. No guessing.
- Parallelize independent tool calls in a single message when possible.

**Git discipline**
- Branch prefix matches commit prefix: `feat/*` → `feat:`, `fix/*` → `fix:`.
- Never `--no-verify`, never `git push --force` without explicit user approval.
- Always create NEW commits after hook failure, never `--amend`.

**Memory discipline**
- Propose feedback/user/project memories when the user corrects you, confirms an unusual choice, or shares a deadline/constraint.
- At session end with significant corrections, suggest running `/learn`.

**Destructive actions** — see the canonical [Safeguards](#safeguards) section above.

## Verification

Changes are complete when:
- Tests pass (`make test` or language equivalent)
- Linting passes (auto-run by hooks)
- No secrets in commits (checked by security hook)
- Commit follows conventional format
